		<h2>About Katarina</h2>
		<p>Decisive in judgment and lethal in combat, Katarina is a Noxian assassin of the highest caliber.

Her fiery ambition has driven her to pursue heavily guarded targets, even at the risk of endangering her alliesâ€”but no matter the mission, Katarina will not hesitate to execute her duty amid a whirlwind of serrated daggers.</p>
